00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.879
hey what's up guys i'm qbhd here and

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.840
these are the new bose noise canceling

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.040
headphones

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040
700.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.559
terrible name that might be the worst

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.839
thing about these headphones so when i

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.039
first saw that bose announced these they

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.119
kind of took me by surprise but the more

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.960
you think about them and use them the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.359
more it makes perfect sense these are a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.000
prime example of competition driving

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.359
things forward and making better

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.240
products for us the consumers you'll see

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.679
what i mean so the most striking part is

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.239
of course the new pretty minimal design

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.800
i don't love it i mean it's definitely a

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.879
unique look it looks fine i think the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.480
look they're going for here is minimal

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.520
and clean

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.719
but i like that they're still matte

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.320
black everything there's also a silver

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.920
version i like that it's pretty

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680
lightweight still and i like that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.840
they're still over ear but they've kind

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.320
of seemingly gotten rid of any visible

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.480
hinges or any broken lines at all it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.079
just kind of looks like these smooth ear

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.559
cups attached to one single stock but

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.480
you can still rotate them around and it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000
still gives you pretty much a hundred

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.760
percent of the flexibility you had

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.600
before the top band is still soft and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.159
the clamp force is still pretty solid

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.840
you put them on and even before turning

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.320
them on they've created a nice seal it's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.080
just definitely a very unique look i

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.840
think the only thing i really don't like

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600
even though i totally get it is the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.439
adjustability for height as you can see

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.400
is now just this smooth slide instead of

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400
the clicks you usually get from like

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.880
every other pair of headphones so this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.520
is less satisfying but you know it makes

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520
sense with this really smooth minimal

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.280
look but then pretty much all the new

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.079
features that they've added are a direct

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.759
response to all the headphones that have

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.680
been coming out over the past year that

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.759
have had all kinds of cool features that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.119
have sort of passed them up like if you

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.079
look back the bose qc series that iconic

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.079
quietcomfort headphone lineup has been

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.399
kind of the same almost stubbornly for

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399
the past couple years even as we evolved

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.320
just because they kind of settled in as

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.240
the industry standard people knew that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.360
if you wanted noise cancelling

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.200
headphones you just got those but then

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.880
along came the microsoft surface

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.600
headphones and the sony xm3s and just a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.439
bunch of others in the last year that

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.520
really had all these crazy 2019 features

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.119
that started to i think actually eat

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.599
into their sales so they had to respond

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.040
so now these new features we get in the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.480
700s i'm just calling them the 700s uh

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.080
many of these new features are just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400
straight from what we just got in this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640
new competition so the 700s now finally

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640
have usb type c where all the quiet

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.959
comforts were micro usb uh these will

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.319
now also they'll connect to two

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.239
different bluetooth devices at once and

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.680
can instantly swap back and forth

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.319
between them love that you now have also

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.400
a touchpad on the side of the right

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.879
headphone with media controls so double

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.360
tap the touchpad to play and pause

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.519
swipe up or swipe down to change the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.080
volume up or down and swipe forward to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.239
go forward swipe backward to go back

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.680
it's not cold enough for me to test if

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200
these like stop working when it's cold

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120
or anything like that but they seem to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.959
work pretty great now and then there are

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.879
three physical buttons so on the right

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.720
side there's the power slash bluetooth

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.800
button so single tap turns it on and off

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.360
and a long press goes to pairing mode

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.280
and then the second button over here is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040
your assistant button so you tap it and

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800
it'll pause your music and use the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.120
excellent built-in mics to let you ask

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120
google assistant things and then on the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.840
left side is a noise cancellation

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.440
adjustment button so you can cycle

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.000
between a maximum of 10 out of 10

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.560
5 out of 10 or 0 out of 10 noise

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080
cancellation and those presets are

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.239
customizable and then the bose music app

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.599
is all fresh and clean and it'll tell

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.840
you exactly how much battery you have

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.599
left to the minute and it'll let you

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.680
dial in any noise cancellation level

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.680
from 1 to 10 at any time which is super

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.920
specific and you can change what

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920
assistant the assistant button triggers

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.519
so if you have a samsung phone you can

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.840
do bixby maybe you want alexa maybe you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
want siri that's your call what that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.159
bose app notably doesn't have is any

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.840
sort of eq control so if you're someone

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.599
who wants to have that extra bass or you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.120
want to add to messing with the way it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.040
sounds out the box these don't do it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.480
from the bose app and i'll say these

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.319
sound just about as high quality as any

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.480
bluetooth headphones have been

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.640
and their sound signature the way they

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.840
sound is unsurprisingly kind of flat

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.280
like that's just the way both headphones

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.959
have sounded for the past couple years

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.879
with the quiet comforts if you're in it

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.080
for that big thumping bass you might

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.079
find these a bit lackluster or

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.238
disappointing but you're rarely buying

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:19.918
these for the big thumping bass you're

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:21.759
buying them for the noise cancellation

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.000
and they definitely deliver on that but

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.080
it's not all roses there are a couple

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320
other things to consider that aren't

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.919
just upgraded features so like i

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.759
mentioned it has usb type c which is

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.840
great but on the other side they have a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.639
2.5 millimeter headphone jack instead of

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.720
3.5 so if you run out of battery or you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.560
want to plug in wired audio for some

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.440
reason

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.759
you have to use i guess their included

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.560
2.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.240
instead of any old regular audio cable

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.759
that you have ready to go that's kind of

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.080
disappointing the case also compared to

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.479
the competition is decently compact but

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.080
not the smallest i think the sony's

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.160
would win again for smallest overall

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.240
travel size because they actually fold

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.840
but the bose case does have this neat

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.160
magnetic flap covering the pocket to put

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.759
in the cables so that's pretty cool but

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.840
i also noticed it doesn't come with the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.440
airline adapter anymore this is the one

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.280
that came with the sony's and they've

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800
come with bose quiet comfort ones in the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.680
past and i feel like just including this

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.160
made me remember that this was like the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.479
default headphones that you listen to on

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.759
a plane

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.520
but they're not included with the 700s i

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.560
don't know maybe they just assume you

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.160
already have one overall though just as

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.280
a package

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.039
this is the upgrade that we've been

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.680
waiting for from bose the sleeping giant

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.320
of noise canceling headphones finally

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.720
got poked enough times into making a

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.280
move and delivering this a better

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.199
overall product in pretty much every

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.280
possible way from the previous

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.960
generation it's better for us so the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.160
natural question a lot of you probably

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.759
wondering is these or the sonys the mark

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.520
iii's that i recently have claimed and a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.960
lot of people agree are pretty much the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.039
king of noise-cancelling headphones now

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.639
which would you pick and there's a lot

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.800
of good reasons now for each of them but

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.520
here's what i will say the sonys are

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.000
lighter because of their plastic

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.680
they also fold down smaller better for

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.000
traveling longer battery life and

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.600
they're 50 dollars cheaper but if you're

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.440
buying headphones for noise cancellation

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.680
the bose are back on top as far as

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.560
actual quality of noise cancellation the

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.000
quality of the built-in mics is

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.479
incredible and the overall build quality

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.639
of the bose headphones is superior so

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.160
for the money the sony might be a little

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.919
bit of a better buy plus i prefer the

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.360
sound from these with a little more

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.120
character a little more fun

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.880
um but i'm glad the competition has

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.000
brought us yet another incredible choice

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.280
that's what you get for having better

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.080
products around so companies compete

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.440
we win

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.560
there it is

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.080
hey thanks for watching

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.919
catch you guys the next one

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.919
peace

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.720
you
